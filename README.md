# Trains

## Authors: Mohcine Zahdi, Mahmoud Mokrane

### Launching the Application:
We divided the application versions into different packages, each package is related to an exercice where we implement a new feature for the program. 
Therefore, to launch the latest version, execute the main class in the `exercice4` package. Packages `exercice2_3` and `exercice1` also work but do not handle a feature where we added an intermediate station for the trains.

### Bugs:
The initial version (package "train") occasionally freezes after a train derails at a station. We have addressed this issue and renamed it to `exercice1`.

### Challenges:
Debugging was challenging as it was difficult to track parameters and anticipate their behavior, given that thread actions vary each time the code is run.
